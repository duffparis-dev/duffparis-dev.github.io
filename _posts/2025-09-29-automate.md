This post is going to be both a tutorial, and a test for the script I am about to show you.

It's quite a simple script, but saves me a lot of time when it comes to posting.

Now all I have to do is write the markdown file, and run the command blogpost path/to/file.md, and voila! the article should be posted.

Here is the script (feel free to use at and replace the variables).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Replace with the name of your blog
REPO_DIR="$HOME/duffparis-dev.github.io"
POSTS_DIR="$REPO_DIR/_posts"

# Get the markdown file from argument
MD_FILE="$1"

# Put the md file in the _posts folder
cp "$MD_FILE" "$POSTS_DIR/"

# Posting
cd "$REPO_DIR"
git pull origin main
git add "_posts/$(basename "$MD_FILE")"
git commit -m "Add post $(basename "$MD_FILE")"
git push origin main

echo "Posted successfully!"
```

Now you can save this as an sh file and run it like so:

```bash
./script.sh file.md
```

But that is rather annoying, as you have to either having the correct working directory or write out the full path.

Alternatively, you can install the script to your PATH:

```bash
sudo nano /bin/blogpost
# paste in the script from before and save
chmod +x /bin/blogpost
```

This way, you can run the script with:

```bash
blogpost file.md
```

regardless of your working directory.

Hope you find this helpful!
